# MAD-Level03_Task02
Task 2 of the third level assignment in "Mobile Application Development" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Computer Science, 5th semester).

## Task
We need to build an application where all the portals (websites) needed for study can be managed. A Recyclerview is used to manage the list of portals. The app comprises two screens: the portal overview screen and the add portal screen. On the add portal screen the user input should be validated. The portals don't currently need to be stored, that is something we will learn in the next level.
